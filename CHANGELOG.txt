2018-10-02:
- modified the code at several places to reflect the changes (fix the broken stuff) introduced by the Rental table and
  the modification of the Book table. Adding some tests once the feature are stabilized a little will a good idea
- created two management commands to be used as scheduled jobs to warn user about tight and overdue rentals
- added a Booking table, but didn't do the logic for it
- cleaned the code for a post on github

2018-10-01:
- renamed Book to GenericBook and BookInstance to Book, it makes more sense in the natural language and in the code
- created first custom migration, involving the renaming of two tables and a FK (intermediate transition to integer is needed)
- added a Rental table, allowing to track current rentals, spot bad subscribers and reveal popular books
