2018-10-15/16:
- Begun testing the code: models done, utils done, serializer done (others still to do) and views to do
    Time spent understanding testing and how testing should be done.
- Adjustments made at several places of the app as a result of the process of writing tests
- new strip_nonascii utils function to handle properly the tests
- factories: ditch most `django_get_or_create` Meta class attributes because we can't get and update at the same time
             and use factory.Sequence in fields that should be unique to reduce the risk of IntegrityError
             and use @post_generate hook to add ManyToMany, which supposes the objects are created
- add some verifications in models.py for books, using clean() (called from save() to force use of clean() in save())
- serializers: attach users to their group, validate entering data of the ModelSerializer and that of related model
               and add create() and update() methods

2018-10-8/9:
- begun to test the code: factories created, some tests on the models
- added an endpoint to create and update librarians using generic views
- update the subscriber and librarian serializers to their respective groups
- generate a username for the subscribers (librarians take the one from the mail system of the library)

2018-10-02:
- modified the code at several places to reflect the changes (fix the broken stuff) introduced by the Rental table and
  the modification of the Book table. Adding some tests once the feature are stabilized a little will a good idea
- created two management commands to be used as scheduled jobs to warn user about tight and overdue rentals
- added a Booking table, but didn't do the logic for it
- cleaned the code for a post on github

2018-10-01:
- renamed Book to GenericBook and BookInstance to Book, it makes more sense in the natural language and in the code
- created first custom migration, involving the renaming of two tables and a FK (intermediate transition to integer is needed)
- added a Rental table, allowing to track current rentals, spot bad subscribers and reveal popular books
