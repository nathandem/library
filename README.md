# Introduction 
Small personal project created to practice python and django.
I'm open to any technical suggestion and remark :)


# Forwards

## Blocking
- complete test coverage of the existing perimeter

## Short-term:
- create the booking views, the associated mgt commands and reflect the changes introduced by this feature in the rest of the code
- create a search feature, at close as possible from the stock django querysets

## Mid-term:
- set-up a email back-end
- deploy the app
- add more data (pay close attention to the migrations not to lose a single drop of data)
- test the app in a real situation (need to find people interested)

## Later:
- store images for the books and subscribers
- add analytics
