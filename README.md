# Introduction 
Small personal project created to practice python and django.
Feel free to comment, I'm open to any technical suggestion and remark :)


# Looking forwards

## Short-term:
- link rentals to the Subscriber model, not the User one and reflect the change in the codebase
- create the booking views, the associated mgt commands and reflect the changes introduced by this feature in the rest of the code
- create a search feature, at close as possible from the stock django querysets

## Mid-term:
- test the core of features now that they should be somehow stable (and find a systematic way to cover new feature with useful and quick to write tests)
- set-up a email back-end
- deploy the app
- add more data (pay close attention to the migrations not to lose a single drop of data)
- test the app in a real situation (need to find people interested)

## Later:
- store images for the books and subscribers
- add analytics
